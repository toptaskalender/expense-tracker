## Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a project designed for [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

#### Note

- I re-styled it, and I'm still working on it for implementing new features.
